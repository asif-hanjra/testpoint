Statement 1: For every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects., Statement 2: The magnitude of the force on the first object equal the magnitude of the force on the second object., Statement 3: Forces always comes in pairs - equal and opposite action reaction force pairs., Statement 4: Action and its reaction act on two same bodies., Statement 5: Action and its reaction act on two different bodies.",
