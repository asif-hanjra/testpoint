(20 marks) Qur'anic Argument on the Life Hereafter Purpose and Accountability : The Qur'an states that life is a test and that humans are created to worship and obey God. Accountability in the Hereafter ensures every action is rewarded or punished. \"Do you think that We created you in play (without any purpose)?\" (Qur'an 23:115). Resurrection and Divine Justice : The Qur'an highlights resurrection as a demonstration of God's power, ensuring ultimate justice. \"And to Allah belongs the Hereafter and the former (life)\" (Qur'an 53:25). \"The Day when everyone will be paid in full for what they have earned\" (Qur'an 3:185). Natural Signs as Evidence : The Qur'an frequently points to signs in nature (e.g., plants revived from dead soil) as evidence of resurrection. \"Look at the earth, how We bring life to it after its death\" (Qur'an 30:19). Impacts on Individual Life Moral Accountability : Awareness of judgment day fosters honesty, integrity, and a strong moral compass. Encouragement of Good Deeds : Promotes acts of charity, kindness, and patience due to the promise of reward. Inner Peace : Belief in divine justice brings comfort in facing life's hardships and injustices. Impacts on Collective Life Promotion of Justice and Social Welfare : Encourages fair dealings and the establishment of justice in society. Strengthening of Social Bonds : Compassion and charity are encouraged, creating trust and support within communities. Discouragement of Social Vices : Reduces crimes, corruption, and exploitation by instilling fear of accountability. In essence, belief in the Hereafter shapes ethical, social, and spiritual behaviors, guiding both individuals and communities toward a just and compassionate society"

      "correct_answer": "500",
      "explanation": "Explanation To find the self-inductance of a coil, we can use the formula: L = (ΔΦ / ΔI) Where: L is the self-inductance in Henry (H), ΔΦ is the change in magnetic flux in Weber (Wb), and ΔI is the change in current in Ampere (A). In this case, the current changes from 5A to 0A (nil) in 5 seconds . (ΔI) is therefore 5A - 0A = 5A. To find the change in (ΔΦ), we can use Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction ΔΦ = L * ΔI Since the current changes from 5A to 0A in 5 seconds , the rate of  (ΔI) is 5A / 5s = 1A/s. Substituting the values into the equation: ΔΦ = L * ΔI 500 V = L * 1 A/s Since the (V) is equal to  (L) and  (ΔI), we can rewrite the equation as: L = 500 V / 1 A/s Simplifying the equation gives us: L = 500 H Therefore, the self-inductance of the coil is 500 Henry (H)."

      "explanation": "Explanation جنگ یمامہ مکمل تفصیل کے ساتھ جنگ یمامہ حضرت ابوبکر صدیق (رض) کے دور خلافت جمادی الاخری سن 12 ہجری میں یمامہ کے مقام پر پیش آئی یہ جنگ مسیلمہ کذاب کے خلاف کی گئی تھی کیونکہ اس ملعون نے نبوت کا جھوٹا دعوہ کیا تھا۔ مسیلمہ کا تعلق یمامہ کے بنی‌ حنیفہ سے تھا۔ مسیلمہ کذاب حضرت محمدؐ کی نبوت کو قبول کرتا تھا لیکن اس کا دعوا یہ تھا کہ وہ نبوت میں آنحضرتؐ کے ساتھ شریک ہیں۔ اس نے اپنے پیروکاروں کیلئے شراب اور زنا کو حلال جبکہ نماز سے سب کو معاف کر دیا تھا۔ مسیلمہ نے \"سجاح بنت حارث تمیمی\" کہ جو خود بھی دعویدار نبوت تھی، سے شادی کیا تھا۔ سجاح ایک کاہنہ عورت تھی۔ ہجرت کے دسویں سال بنی حنیفہ کا ایک وفد مدینہ منورہ میں آپ ﷺ کی خدمت میں حاضر ہوا۔ اس وفد میں مسیلمہ کذاب بھی شامل تھا۔ تمام افراد نے اسلام قبول کیا۔ مسیلمہ کذاب جب یمامہ میں گیا تو وہ مرتد ہوگیا اور اس نے نبوت کا دعویٰ کردیا بہت سے لوگوں نے اس کے دعویٰ کو قبول کر لیا۔ چنانچہ اس نے اپنی قوم کے دس افراد کو سفیر بنا کر حضور اقدس ﷺ کے پاس بھیجا اوران کے ہاتھ ایک خط بھیجا جس میں تحریر تھا کہ میں آپ ﷺ کے ساتھ نبوت میں شریک ہوں۔ نصف دنیا آپ کی ہے اور نصف میری ہے۔ مسیلمہ کے اس خط کو آپ ﷺ پڑھ کر جلال میں آگئے اور مسواک کی لکڑی جو کہ دست مبارک میں پکڑی ہوئی تھی۔ فرمایا اللہ کی قسم اگر وہ مجھ سے اس کو بھی مانگے تو میں اس کو نہیں دوں گا۔ پھر آپ نے قاصدوں سے پوچھا تم اس بارے میں کیا کہتے ہو تو انہوں نے کہا ہم وہی کہتے ہیں جو مسیلمہ کہتا ہے ۔ آپ ﷺ نے فرمایا اگر قاصد کو قتل کرنا منع نہ ہوتا تو میں تمہاری گردن اڑا دیتا۔ چنانچہ حکم دیا کہ مسیلمہ کے خط کا یہ جواب لکھا جائے۔ حضرت محمد رسول اللہ (صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم) کی طرف سے مسیلمہ کذاب کو اما بعد زمین اللہ کی ہے وہ اپنے بندوں میں سے جس کو چاہتا ہے اس کا وارث بناتا ہے۔ آپ کے واضح جواب کے باوجود مسیلمہ کذاب اپنے دعویٰ پر قائم رہا۔ یہاں تک کہ آپ ﷺ نے اس جہاں سے رحلت فرمائی تو مسیلمہ کذاب نے نبوت کے دعویٰ میں تیزی دکھانی شروع کردی۔ یہاں تک کہ ایک لاکھ سے زیادہ افراد اس پر ایمان لے آئے ۔ مسیلمہ کذاب جادو اور شعبدہ بازی کا فن جانتا تھا جس سے لوگ جلد اس کے جال میں پھنس جاتے تھے حضرت محمد صلی اللہ علیہ و آلہ وسلم کے وصال کے بعد عرب میں جو نبوت کے دعویدار سامنے آئے ان میں سب سے طاقتور مسیلمہ کذاب تھا۔ جب مسلمان دیگر مرتدین کے خاتمے میں مصروف تھے اس دوران مسیلمہ اپنا دعویٰ نبوت عام کرنے میں مصروف رہا اور اس نے اتنی طاقت حاصل کر لی کہ اس کا لشکر چالیس ہزار تک پہنچ  چکی تھی۔ امیر المؤمنین حضرت ابوبکر رضی اللہ عنہ نے تمام فتنوں کی سرکوبی کےلئے مجموعی طور پر گیارہ لشکر ترتیب دیئے تھے ، اس میں ایک دستہ حضرت عکرمہ رضی اللہ عنہ بن ابو جہل کی قیادت میں مسیلمہ کذاب کی سرکوبی کےلئے یمامہ کی طرف روانہ کیا اور ان کی مدد کےلئے حضرت شرحبیل رضی اللہ عنہ بن حسنہ کو کچھ فوج کے ساتھ ان کے پیچھے روانہ کردیا تھا اور عکرمہ رضی اللہ عنہ کو حکم دیا کہ جب تک دوسرا لشکر آپ تک نہ پہنچے حملہ نہ کرنا ،شرحبیل رضی اللہ عنہ کی آمد سے پہلے ہی حضرت عکرمہ رضی اللہ عنہ نے حملہ کردیا جس کے نتیجے میں حضرت عکرمہ رضی اللہ عنہ کو شکست ہوئی اور پھر حضرت ابو بکر صدیق رضی اللہ عنہ کوجب ان کی شکست کی خبر ملی تو حضرت خالد بن ولید رضی اللہ عنہ کو ( جوکہ بنی طئے کی مہم سے فارغ ہوچکے تھے ) مسیلمہ کے خلاف معرکہ آراءہونے کا حکم دیا پھر ایک لشکر ان کےلئے ترتیب دیا جس میں مہاجرین پر حضرت ابو حذیفہ رضی اللہ عنہ اور حضرت زید بن خطاب رضی اللہ عنہ ( فاروق اعظم رضی اللہ عنہ کے بھائی ) اور انصار پر حضرت ثابت بن قیس رضی اللہ عنہ اور حضرت براءبن عازب رضی اللہ عنہ کو امیر مقرر کیا ۔ جب حضرت خالد رضی اللہ عنہ یمامہ پہنچے تو مسیلمہ کذاب کے لشکر کی تعداد چالیس ہزار تک پہنچ چکی تھی جبکہ مسلمانوں کا لشکر 13 ہزار نفوس پر مشتمل تھا ۔ مسیلمہ کذاب نے جب حضرت خالد رضی اللہ عنہ کی آمد کی اطلاع سنی تو آگے بڑھ کر عقربا نامی مقام پر پڑاؤ ڈالا۔ اسلامی لشکر اور مسیلمہ کزاب کے لشکر میں نہایت سخت مقابلہ ہوا۔ پہلا مقابلہ بنو حنیفہ سے ہوا۔ اسلامی لشکر نے اس دلیری سے مقابلہ کیا کہ بنو حنیفہ بد حواس ہو کر بھاگ نکلے اور مسیلمہ کے باقی آدمی ایک ایک کر کے حضرت خالد بن ولید (رض) کی فوجوں کا نشانہ بنتے رہے۔ جب مسیلمہ نے لڑائی کی یہ صورت حال دیکھی تو وہ اپنے فوجیوں کے ساتھ جان بچا کر بھاگ نکلا اور میدان جنگ سے کچھ دور ایک باغ میں پناہ لی لیکن مسلمانوں کو تو اس فتنے کو جڑ سے اکھاڑنا تھا اس لیے حضرت خالد بن ولید (رض) نے باغ کا محاصرہ کر لیا۔ باغ کی دیوار اتنی اونچی تھی کے اس کو کوئی بھی پار نہیں کر سکتا تھا۔ اس وقت ایک صحابی حضرت زید بن قیس (رض) نے حضرت خالد بن ولید (رض) کو فرمایا میں یہ دیوار پار کر کے تمہارے لیے دروازے کو کھول دوں گا اگر تم میرے لیے ایک اونچی سیڑھی بنا دو حضرت خالد بن ولید (رض) راضی ہو گئے۔ اگلے دن حضرت زید بن قیس (رض) سیڑھی کے ساتھ باغ میں اتر گئے۔ تب مسیلمہ کذاب نے اپنے فوجیوں کو حکم دیا کہ اس کو قتل کر دو۔ تب اس کے فوجیوں نے حضرت زید بن قیس (رض) کے ساتھ لڑائی شروع کردی۔ لڑائی میں حضرت زید بن قیس (رض) کا کندھا کٹ گیا۔ پھر بھی انہوں نے دروازے کو کھول دیا۔ ادھر مسلمان صف بندی کرچکے تھے۔ مسلمان نعرہ لگاتے ہوئے اندر داخل ہونا شروع ہو گئے اور ایک دفعہ پھر گھمسان کی جنگ شروع ہو گئی۔ اچانک حضرت خالد بن ولید (رض) نیزہ لے کر مسیلمہ کو پکارنے لگے،یا عدو الله!اور مسیلمہ پر پھینک دیا، مگر اس کے محافظوں نے ڈھال بن کر اس کو بچالیا۔ اس وقت اس کے محافظ غیر حتمی طور پر اسے چھوڑ کے چلے گئے۔ پھر اسے حضرت حمزہ کے قاتل وحشی بن حرب(جو مسلمان ہوچکے تھے) نے ایسا نیزہ مارا کہ مسیلمہ وہیں ڈھیر ہو گیا۔ اس طرح اس نے حضرت حمزہ (رض) کو شہید کرنے کا کفارہ ادا کیا. مسیلمہ کے چالیس ہزار کے لشکر میں سے تقریباً 21 ہزار افراد موت کے گھاٹ اتاردئے گئے مسیلمہ جس دن قتل ہوا اس کی عمر ڈیڑہ سو سال تھی۔ مسلمانوں میں سے صرف 660 آدمی شہید ہوئے ۔مسیلمہ کذاب کی موت کے بعد اس کا قبیلہ بنی حنیفہ صدق دل سے دوبارہ اسلام میں داخل ہوگیا ۔ مؤرخین نے لکھا ہے کہ یہ جنگ (یمامہ ) جھوٹے مدعی نبوت کے خلاف آخری معرکہ تھا جس کے بعد دور صدیقی رضی اللہ عنہ میں کسی اور شخص کو نبوت کا جھوٹا دعویٰ کرنے کی ہمت نہ ہوسکی ۔"
