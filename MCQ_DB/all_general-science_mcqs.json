      "correct_answer": "Temperature and humidity of the air",
      "explanation": "Explanation The speed of sound in air is affected by two main factors: Temperature : As temperature increases, the speed of sound increases . This is because warmer air is less dense , allowing sound waves to travel faster. Humidity : As humidity increases, the speed of sound decreases slightly . This is because water vapor in the air adds mass to the air molecules, making them slightly heavier and slower."

        "Gas molecules move faster"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Solid molecules are packed tightly",
      "explanation": "Explanation Sound travels faster in solids than in gases because the molecules in a solid are packed more tightly together , allowing the energy to be transferred more efficiently. In contrast, in a gas , the molecules are spaced farther apart and are free to move randomly, making it harder for the sound wave to propagate."

      "correct_answer": "Frictional force",
      "explanation": "Explanation Oscillations are damped due to the presence of frictional force. Frictional force opposes motion and converts some of the kinetic energy into heat energy, causing the oscillations to decay over time. There are three main types of frictional force that can cause damping: Viscous damping (e.g., air resistance, water resistance) Coulomb damping ( e.g., friction between surfaces ) Internal damping ( e.g., within the material itself )"

Since 1 cm^2 = 0.0001 m^2, the area in square meters is: 5 cm^2 x (0.0001 m^2/cm^2) = 0.0005 m^2 Now, you can calculate the pressure: Pressure = Force / Area = 20 N / 0.0005 m^2 = 40,000 N/m^2 Since 1 N/m^2 = 1 Pascal (Pa), you can convert the pressure to N/cm^2: 40,000 N/m^2 x (1 m^2 / 100 cm^2) = 4 N/cm^2"

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Remains above the point of contact",
      "explanation": "Explanation When a body is in unstable equilibrium , a slight tilt will cause its center of gravity (CG) to remain above the point of contact , making it prone to toppling over or falling. This means that the CG is not directly over the point of support, but is still above it , creating a moment that tends to rotate the body further. Key Points : A body is in stable equilibrium after slight tilt if its center of gravity remains above the point of contact. A body is in neutral equilibrium when its center of gravity remains at same height."

      "correct_answer": "1.6 ms^-2",
      "explanation": "Explanation To find the acceleration of the sledge , we can use Newton's second law of motion: F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the sledge , m is its mass, and a is its acceleration. First, we need to find the net force acting on the sledge . The force applied by the man is 60 N, and the force of friction is 20 N, so the net force is : F = 60 N - 20 N = 40 N Next, we can plug in the values to Newton's second law: 40 N = (25 kg) × a To find the acceleration, we can divide both sides by the mass: a = 40 N / 25 kg = 1.6 ms^-2 Therefore, the acceleration of the sledge is 1.6 ms^-2."

Ribosomes : Protein synthesis occurs here , and the newly synthesized protein is released into the cytosol. RER (Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum) : The protein is transported to the RER , where it is processed and modified (e.g., folding, glycosylation). Golgi body : The protein is packaged into vesicles and transported to the Golgi body, where it is further modified and sorted. Lysosome : The protein is delivered to lysosomes , where it can be used for various cellular processes (e.g., digestion, recycling)."

      "explanation": "Explanation Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, and it remains constant regardless of where you are in the universe. Your mass on Earth is the same as your mass on the Moon , because you are still made up of the same amount of matter. However, your weight (the force exerted on you by gravity) would be different on the Moon, because the Moon has a much weaker gravitational field than Earth."
